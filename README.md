# meshNYC

meshNYC is a p2p messaging prototype for the Android platform (API level 14+). It allows users to relay messages between nearby devices without a central router or cellular service. It was created in less than 48 hours for the Access Code 2.1 Hackthon on August 1 - 3, 2015.

meshNYC utilizes mesh network technology to relay text messages through a wifi-chip router service, and allow for communication in emergency situations where traditional cell service is unusable. The app also includes a feature that parsed a NYC Social Services API to populate a cached map of all local shelters, and access to the NYC emergency alert twitter + Google’s public alerts service. 

meshNYC was chosen as the winner of the hackathon by a panel of judges consisting of Hilary Clinton’s CTO, Chairman of NY Angels, NYTM Director of Operations, and Robin Hood Foundation Founder.
